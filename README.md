## Features
### Learnings
Learnings (or *Learns*) contain essential information about some topic within the health area. For example, on day 1 user can read *Learn* with "What is healthy eating?" title, for reading it user receives 10 **Learn XP**.
### Actions
- There are daily **Tasks** that do not repeat. These are coloured white and are usually relevant to the current Learn. Some Tasks automatically turn into **Habits** (yellow colour), which means that on a given day, the Task will become a Habit that the user will need to complete every day.
- However, a Habit can only be removed 7 days after its creation. Also, any Task can be marked as a Habit manually by the user.
- Users receive **Action XP** for completing Tasks and Habits, but double the amount for Habits.
- Users can also *incomplete* Tasks/Habits, and the appropriate amount of Action XP will be subtracted from their accounts.
- Tasks can be delayed (Habits not), but then user will receive twice less XP.
### Companion
Currently, in the nutrition health area, Companion refers to the plant that grows automatically as the user gains **Learn XP**.
- For every 10 Learn XP that a user earns, their companion grows by one, starting from stage 1 and continuing until stage 8.
- User can change his Companion type, currently there are two options available: Plant (default) and Cactus.
- Users can purchase accessories for their Companion, e.g. different pots and pot stickers, using Action XP.
